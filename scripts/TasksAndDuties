Notes about Lecture

- It's good to have some model (regression, or any other models) for which we can have a some
visual representation for. Like graphs or tables maybe.

- Should include a good data manipulation techniques
    Maybe changing something into factor and doing an analysis
    Or Changing some variable into ranges like the `updiv.num` was in the background?
  
- Editing a report file could also be a task!

- Reports should be something original, do not replicate! Reports should be short and new stuff.

    - Whether having a specific domain restricts you in your preferances for the project?
      - response variable: preferance
      - predictive variables: number of upper div classes, research exp, dom 
      
      Have a table with all variables (one on x axis, one on y axis) / summary statistic
      Have some sort of multiple boxplots / dotplot or smth like this
      Logistic regression

    - Comfort level vs proficiency for each (one-to-one: math prof --> math comf etc)
    Is there a significant difference between means of comfort level vs proficiency level across
    all three areas
    
      We could do some statistical testing and have p values to check whether there is a diff
        Present the results in a table where conf interval and p values and alpha values are there
        also talk about type 1 and type 2 errors??
